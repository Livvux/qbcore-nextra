# Quick Start Guide - Set Up in 10 Minutes

**‚ö° Estimated Time: 10 minutes | üéØ Difficulty: Beginner | üöÄ Perfect for First-Time Users**

Get your QBCore FiveM roleplay server up and running in under 10 minutes! This streamlined guide covers the essential steps to have a basic QBCore server ready for your community.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ **FiveM Server** - A working FiveM server installation
- ‚úÖ **MySQL Database** - MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+
- ‚úÖ **Basic Knowledge** - Familiarity with FiveM server management
- ‚úÖ **Text Editor** - VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar

## Step 1: Download QBCore

Get the latest version of QBCore from our official repository:

```bash
# Clone the main QBCore repository
git clone https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core.git [qb-core]

# Clone essential resources
git clone https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-multicharacter.git [qb-multicharacter]
git clone https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-spawn.git [qb-spawn]
git clone https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-garages.git [qb-garages]
```

Alternatively, download the [QBCore Starter Pack](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-starter) which includes all essential resources.

## Step 2: Database Setup

1. **Create a new MySQL database** for your server
2. **Import the QBCore SQL file** located in `qb-core/server/database.sql`
3. **Configure your database connection** in your server configuration

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE qbcore;

-- Import the base structure
SOURCE qb-core/server/database.sql;
```

## Step 3: Server Configuration

Update your `server.cfg` file with the essential QBCore resources:

```bash
# QBCore Framework
ensure qb-core
ensure qb-multicharacter
ensure qb-spawn
ensure qb-garages

# Optional but recommended
ensure qb-inventory
ensure qb-hud
ensure qb-phone
```

## Step 4: Configure QBCore

Edit the configuration file at `qb-core/config.lua`:

```lua
QBConfig = {}

-- Core Settings
QBConfig.MaxPlayers = GetConvarInt('sv_maxclients', 48)
QBConfig.DefaultSpawn = vector4(-1035.71, -2731.87, 12.86, 0.0)

-- Database Configuration
QBConfig.Server = {
    ['hostname'] = 'localhost',
    ['username'] = 'your_username',
    ['password'] = 'your_password',
    ['database'] = 'qbcore',
    ['port'] = 3306
}

-- Money Configuration
QBConfig.Money = {
    ['MoneyTypes'] = {
        ['cash'] = 500,    -- Starting cash
        ['bank'] = 5000,   -- Starting bank money
        ['crypto'] = 0     -- Starting crypto
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Start Your Server

1. **Start your FiveM server** with the updated configuration
2. **Check the console** for any errors
3. **Connect to your server** and test character creation

If everything is configured correctly, you should see:
- QBCore loading messages in the console
- Character creation screen when connecting
- No critical errors in the server logs

## Essential Commands

Once your server is running, these commands will be helpful:

### Admin Commands
```bash
# Give yourself admin permissions
/setgroup [player_id] admin

# Give money to a player
/givemoney [player_id] [type] [amount]

# Set a player's job
/setjob [player_id] [job] [grade]
```

### Player Commands
```bash
# Check your character info
/me

# Check your money
/bank

# Logout and return to character selection
/logout
```
