# How to Become Admin in QBCore

This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up administrator permissions in your QBCore server. Whether you're setting up a new server or need to grant admin access to trusted players, this tutorial covers everything you need to know.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Access to your server files and database
- QBCore framework installed and running
- Basic understanding of server administration
- Database management tool (HeidiSQL, phpMyAdmin, etc.)

## Understanding QBCore Permission System

QBCore uses a permission-based system with different admin levels:

- **god**: Highest level admin (usually server owners)
- **admin**: Full administrative privileges
- **mod**: Moderator privileges (limited admin functions)

## Method 1: Database Modification (Recommended)

### Step 1: Access Your Database

1. Open your database management tool
2. Connect to your QBCore database
3. Navigate to the `players` table

### Step 2: Locate the Player

Find the player you want to make admin by searching for their:
- `citizenid` (unique identifier)
- `license` (FiveM license)
- `name` (character name)

### Step 3: Update Permission Level

1. Locate the `permission` column in the players table
2. Change the value to your desired admin level:
   ```sql
   UPDATE players SET permission = 'god' WHERE citizenid = 'ABC12345';
   ```

3. Save the changes

### Step 4: Restart the Server

Restart your QBCore server for changes to take effect.

## Method 2: In-Game Commands (If You're Already Admin)

If you already have admin permissions, you can use in-game commands:

### Basic Admin Commands

```
/setpermission [player_id] [permission_level]
/givepermission [player_id] [permission_level]
/makeadmin [player_id]
```

### Examples

```
/setpermission 1 admin
/setpermission 5 god  
/makeadmin 12
```

## Method 3: Configuration File Method

### Step 1: Locate Config File

Find your QBCore configuration file, typically located at:
```
resources/[qb]/qb-core/config.lua
```

### Step 2: Add to Admin List

Look for a section like `Config.Admins` or similar and add the player's license:

```lua
Config.Admins = {
    ["license:1234567890abcdef"] = "god",
    ["license:abcdef1234567890"] = "admin",
    ["license:567890abcdef1234"] = "mod"
}
```

### Step 3: Get Player License

To find a player's license:
1. Have them join the server
2. Check server logs or use command: `/license [player_id]`
3. Look for format: `license:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Method 4: Using qb-admin Resource

If you have qb-admin installed:

### Step 1: Access Admin Menu

1. Press your admin menu key (usually F6 or as configured)
2. Navigate to "Player Management"
3. Find the target player

### Step 2: Assign Permissions

1. Select the player from the list
2. Choose "Set Permission Level"
3. Select desired level (god/admin/mod)
4. Confirm the change

## Verifying Admin Status

### In-Game Verification

Test admin commands to verify permissions:

```
/admin          # Open admin menu
/noclip         # Toggle noclip mode
/tp [player_id] # Teleport to player
/kick [player_id] [reason]
/ban [player_id] [reason]
```

### Database Verification

Check the database to confirm the permission was set:

```sql
SELECT citizenid, name, permission FROM players WHERE permission IN ('god', 'admin', 'mod');
```

## Common Admin Commands

Once you have admin permissions, these commands become available:

### Player Management
```
/kick [id] [reason]        # Kick a player
/ban [id] [reason]         # Ban a player  
/unban [license]           # Unban a player
/warn [id] [reason]        # Warn a player
```

### Server Management
```
/announce [message]        # Server announcement
/revive [id]              # Revive a player
/heal [id]                # Heal a player
/armor [id] [amount]      # Give armor
```

### Utility Commands
```
/noclip                   # Toggle noclip
/godmode                  # Toggle god mode
/invisible                # Toggle invisibility
/tp [id/coords]          # Teleport
```

## Creating Additional Admin Levels

You can create custom admin levels by modifying the QBCore framework:

### Step 1: Edit Core Config

In `qb-core/config.lua`, add custom permission levels:

```lua
Config.PermissionLevels = {
    ['user'] = 0,
    ['helper'] = 1,
    ['mod'] = 2,
    ['admin'] = 3,
    ['god'] = 4,
    ['owner'] = 5  -- Custom level
}
```

### Step 2: Update Permission Checks

Modify permission checks in your scripts:

```lua
local function HasPermission(source, level)
    local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(source)
    if not Player then return false end
    
    local playerLevel = Config.PermissionLevels[Player.PlayerData.permission] or 0
    local requiredLevel = Config.PermissionLevels[level] or 0
    
    return playerLevel >= requiredLevel
end
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Limit God-Level Access
Only give 'god' permissions to server owners and highly trusted administrators.

### 2. Regular Permission Audits
Regularly review who has admin access:

```sql
SELECT citizenid, name, permission, last_updated FROM players 
WHERE permission IN ('god', 'admin', 'mod') 
ORDER BY permission DESC;
```

### 3. Use Appropriate Permission Levels
- **God**: Server owners only
- **Admin**: Trusted staff for server management
- **Mod**: Community moderators for basic moderation

### 4. Keep Logs
Enable admin action logging to track admin command usage:

```lua
Config.AdminLogs = true
Config.AdminLogWebhook = "your_discord_webhook_url"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Not Working

1. **Check Database**: Verify the permission is set correctly in the database
2. **Restart Server**: Changes may require a server restart
3. **Check Spelling**: Ensure permission level is spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
4. **Player Reconnection**: Have the player disconnect and reconnect

### Commands Not Available

1. **Resource Running**: Ensure qb-admin or equivalent admin resource is started
2. **Permission Level**: Verify the player has sufficient permission level
3. **Script Conflicts**: Check for conflicting admin resources

### Database Connection Issues

1. **Connection String**: Verify database connection in server.cfg
2. **Permissions**: Ensure database user has proper permissions
3. **Table Structure**: Confirm players table has permission column

## Advanced Admin Setup

### Creating Admin Groups

For larger servers, consider creating admin groups:

```lua
Config.AdminGroups = {
    ['management'] = {
        level = 'god',
        commands = {'all'}
    },
    ['staff'] = {
        level = 'admin', 
        commands = {'kick', 'warn', 'tp', 'heal'}
    },
    ['moderators'] = {
        level = 'mod',
        commands = {'warn', 'kick'}
    }
}
```

### Custom Admin Menu

Create a custom admin menu with specific tools for your server:

```lua
Config.AdminMenuItems = {
    {
        title = 'Player Management',
        items = {
            {label = 'Kick Player', command = 'kick'},
            {label = 'Ban Player', command = 'ban'},
            {label = 'Heal Player', command = 'heal'}
        }
    },
    {
        title = 'Server Tools',
        items = {
            {label = 'Server Announcement', command = 'announce'},
            {label = 'Weather Control', command = 'weather'},
            {label = 'Time Control', command = 'time'}
        }
    }
}
```
