## Framework Structure

QBCore follows a modular design with these core components:

### Core Framework (`qb-core`)
The main framework that handles:
- Player data management
- Database operations
- Event system
- Utility functions

### Essential Resources
- `qb-multicharacter` - Character selection
- `qb-spawn` - Player spawning system
- `qb-hud` - User interface
- `qb-inventory` - Item management
- `qb-menu` - Interactive menus

### Job Resources
- `qb-policejob` - Police department
- `qb-ambulancejob` - Emergency medical services
- `qb-mechanicjob` - Vehicle repair services

## Your First QBCore Server

### 1. Installation
Follow our installation guide for your operating system:
- [Windows Installation](/docs/installation/windows)
- [Linux Installation](/docs/installation/linux)

### 2. Basic Configuration
After installation, configure these essential settings:

**Server Information** (`server.cfg`):
```cfg
sv_hostname "Your Server Name"
sv_projectName "Your Project"
sv_maxclients 32
```

**Database Connection**:
```cfg
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://username:password@localhost/database"
```

### 3. Admin Setup
Set yourself as admin:
```cfg
add_principal identifier.steam:YOUR_STEAM_ID group.admin
```

### 4. First Launch
Start your server and connect to test the basic functionality.

## Understanding QBCore Concepts

### Player Object
Every player has a persistent object containing:
- Personal information (name, DOB, etc.)
- Job and job grade
- Money (cash, bank, crypto)
- Inventory items
- Metadata

### Jobs and Grades
Jobs define player roles with different grades (ranks):
```lua
-- Example job structure
['police'] = {
    label = 'Police',
    defaultDuty = true,
    grades = {
        ['0'] = { name = 'Cadet', payment = 50 },
        ['1'] = { name = 'Officer', payment = 75 },
        ['2'] = { name = 'Sergeant', payment = 100 }
    }
}
```

### Items and Inventory
Items are defined in the shared configuration:
```lua
-- Example item
['bread'] = {
    name = 'bread',
    label = 'Bread',
    weight = 200,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'bread.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'Delicious bread'
}
```

## Essential Commands

### Admin Commands
- `/admin` - Open admin menu
- `/noclip` - Toggle noclip mode
- `/tp [player]` - Teleport to player
- `/setjob [player] [job] [grade]` - Set player job

### Player Commands
- `/job` - Check current job
- `/cash` - Check cash amount
- `/bank` - Check bank balance
- `/inventory` - Open inventory

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Basic Script
```lua
-- client.lua
local QBCore = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()

RegisterNetEvent('QBCore:Client:OnPlayerLoaded', function()
    -- Player loaded logic
end)

-- server.lua
local QBCore = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()

QBCore.Functions.CreateCallback('script:getPlayerData', function(source, cb)
    local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(source)
    cb(Player.PlayerData)
end)
```

### Using Framework Functions
```lua
-- Get player object
local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(source)

-- Add money
Player.Functions.AddMoney('bank', 1000)

-- Add item
Player.Functions.AddItem('bread', 1)

-- Check job
if Player.PlayerData.job.name == 'police' then
    -- Police-specific logic
end
```
