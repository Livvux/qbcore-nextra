# Goal

Resolve common errors when clients cannot connect to your server.

## Symptoms

- `Connecting failed. Failed to connect to server`
- `Connection refused by server`
- Server console shows `Could not start resource` or license key warnings

## Steps

1. **Verify server is listening**
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep 30120
   ```
   Ensure both TCP and UDP are open.
2. **Check license key**
   - Confirm `sv_licenseKey` is set in `server.cfg`
   - Generate keys at [keymaster.fivem.net](https://keymaster.fivem.net)
3. **Inspect firewall**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 30120/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 30120/udp
   ```
4. **Review server logs**
   Look for missing resources or database errors in the console.

## Verification

- Clients reach the `Connecting to server` screen without errors
- No `connection refused` messages in console
