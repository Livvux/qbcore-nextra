# Symptoms and Fixes

## Server won't start

**Error:** `Couldn't find resource qb-core`

**Fix:** ensure `qb-core` folder exists in `resources` and `server.cfg` has `ensure qb-core`.

## Players can't join

**Error:** `Connection refused`

**Fix:** verify firewall ports (default 30120) and that server is running.
