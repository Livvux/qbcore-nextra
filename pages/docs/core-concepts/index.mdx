# Core Concepts

Understand the main systems that power QB-Core.

## Players

Each player has a persistent identifier and metadata stored in the database.

## Jobs

Jobs define roles and permissions. Switch duty using:
```lua
TriggerServerEvent('QBCore:ToggleDuty')
```

## Inventory

Items are defined in `qb-core/shared/items.lua` and synchronized between client and server.
