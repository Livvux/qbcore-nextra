# üóÑÔ∏è Database Documentation

Comprehensive database documentation for QBCore servers, including schema design, optimization techniques, and management best practices.

## Database Overview

QBCore uses **MySQL/MariaDB** as its primary database system, storing all persistent server data including player information, inventories, vehicles, properties, and more.

### Core Database Components

- **Player Data** - Character information, metadata, positions
- **Inventory Systems** - Items, stashes, trunks, glovebox storage  
- **Vehicle Management** - Owned vehicles, modifications, damage states
- **Property Systems** - Houses, apartments, businesses, garages
- **Job Systems** - Employment data, grades, payments
- **Economy** - Banking, transactions, business finances

## Database Structure

### Core Framework Tables
- `players` - Primary player data and character information
- `playerskins` - Character appearance and clothing data
- `player_vehicles` - Vehicle ownership and modifications
- `player_houses` - Property ownership and settings

### Resource-Specific Tables
- `management_*` - Business and gang management systems
- `phone_*` - Phone app data and communications
- `banking_*` - Financial transactions and accounts
- `racing_*` - Racing event data and leaderboards

## Quick Start

### Essential Queries

```sql
-- Get player basic info
SELECT citizenid, charinfo, money, job FROM players WHERE citizenid = ?

-- Get player vehicles
SELECT * FROM player_vehicles WHERE citizenid = ?

-- Get player inventory
SELECT * FROM playerskins WHERE citizenid = ?
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Index Key Columns** - Always index citizenid and frequently queried fields
2. **Limit Result Sets** - Use LIMIT clauses to prevent large data transfers
3. **Optimize WHERE Clauses** - Structure conditions for optimal index usage
4. **Regular Maintenance** - Keep statistics updated and optimize tables

## Schema Documentation

The following sections provide detailed documentation for all QBCore database schemas, including table structures, relationships, and optimization recommendations.

### Available Documentation

- **Core Schema** - Essential QBCore framework tables
- **Resource Schemas** - Individual resource database structures
- **Optimization Guide** - Performance tuning and best practices
- **Backup & Restore** - Data protection strategies
- **Migrations** - Version upgrade procedures
- **Monitoring** - Performance tracking and alerting

## Best Practices

### Data Integrity
- Use appropriate data types for each field
- Implement proper foreign key constraints where applicable
- Validate data before insertion
- Use transactions for multi-table operations

### Performance
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid SELECT * in production code
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Monitor slow query logs regularly

### Security
- Never expose database credentials in client-side code
- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits and updates
