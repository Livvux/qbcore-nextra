### 2. Code Architecture & Quality

#### QBCore Architecture

```lua
-- Modern QBCore pattern - Clean and organized
local QBCore = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()

-- Player management
local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(source)
if not Player then return end

-- Built-in functions with consistent naming
QBCore.Functions.Notify(source, "Welcome!", "success")
Player.Functions.AddMoney('cash', 1000)
Player.Functions.SetJob('police', 2)
```

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Consistent API**: Standardized function naming and structure
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add/remove components
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error checking and validation
- **Type Safety**: Better Lua patterns and practices

#### ESX Architecture

```lua
-- Traditional ESX pattern - More verbose
ESX = nil
TriggerEvent('esx:getSharedObject', function(obj) ESX = obj end)

-- Player management (more complex)
local xPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(source)
if xPlayer == nil then return end

-- Different syntax patterns across resources
TriggerClientEvent('esx:showNotification', source, 'Welcome!')
xPlayer.addMoney(1000)
xPlayer.setJob('police', 2)
```

**Architecture Limitations**:
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different coding styles across resources
- **Legacy Code**: Old Lua patterns and practices
- **Complex Setup**: More boilerplate code required
- **Callback Hell**: Nested callbacks in older resources

### 5. Database & Structure Analysis

#### QBCore Database Design

```sql
-- Modern, normalized database structure
-- Player table (optimized)
CREATE TABLE `players` (
  `citizenid` varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  `cid` int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `license` varchar(255),
  `name` varchar(255),
  `money` longtext, -- JSON format for multiple currencies
  `charinfo` longtext, -- JSON format for character data
  `job` longtext, -- JSON format with grade and payment
  `gang` longtext, -- JSON format with rank and area
  `position` longtext, -- JSON format for coordinates
  `metadata` longtext, -- JSON format for additional data
  `inventory` longtext, -- JSON format for items
  -- Additional optimized fields
);

-- Optimized indexes for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_license ON players (license);
CREATE INDEX idx_citizenid ON players (citizenid);
```

**Database Benefits**:
- **JSON Storage**: Flexible data structure for complex objects
- **Optimized Indexes**: Fast query performance
- **Consistent Schema**: Standardized across all resources
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend without schema changes

#### ESX Database Design

```sql
-- Traditional relational database structure
-- Multiple tables for user data
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `identifier` varchar(60) PRIMARY KEY,
  `accounts` longtext,
  `group` varchar(50),
  `inventory` longtext,
  `job` varchar(20),
  `job_grade` int(11),
  `loadout` longtext,
  `position` varchar(255),
  `skin` longtext
);

-- Separate tables for different features
CREATE TABLE `user_accounts` (...);
CREATE TABLE `user_inventory` (...);
CREATE TABLE `jobs` (...);
CREATE TABLE `job_grades` (...);
-- Many more tables...
```

**Database Limitations**:
- **Complex Relationships**: Multiple tables with complex joins
- **Performance Impact**: More queries required for basic operations
- **Schema Rigidity**: Difficult to extend without database changes
- **Inconsistent Structure**: Varies between different ESX resources
