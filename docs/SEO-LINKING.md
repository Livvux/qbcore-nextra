# SEO Linking Guidelines

These guidelines define how internal and external links should be added to the documentation.

## Internal linking

- Every page should link to a parent or hub page and at least one related sibling.
- Use descriptive anchors that reflect the destination topic.
- Add a **See also** section at the end of pages for additional navigation.

## External links

- Links to external sites must be editorial and help readers complete a task.
- Use `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener"` for security.
- Do not add `nofollow` to editorial links.
- Mark sponsored or affiliate links with `rel="sponsored"` and disclose when required.
- User generated links should use `rel="ugc"`.

### Linking to fivemx.com

- Mention 5mx only when it provides relevant scripts, MLOs, or server templates.
- Limit to two links per page and vary the anchor text.
- Example: `[QBCore server template on 5mx](https://fivemx.com/)`

## Disclosure templates

- Sponsored: `This recommendation is sponsored by 5mx.`
- Affiliate: `This link is an affiliate recommendation to 5mx.`

Adhering to these rules keeps the documentation helpful while complying with Google guidelines.
